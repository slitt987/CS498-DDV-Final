                            Kickstarter is a crowd funding platform that has gained a lot of popularity over the past few
                            years supporting over 300,000 projects in over 20 countries.  In the next few slides we will try
                            to identify what are the characteristics of a successful Kickstarter project in case you find
                            yourself looking to either launch a project or become a backer.
                        </p>

                            As you work your way through these slides please make sure to take time to view the different
                            dimensional filters available to you and look through the different metrics as they tell surprisingly
                            different stories.

                            Here we see the performance of Kickstarter projects around the world.  As you can see international
                            country roll-out was slow (seemingly as they added international currency support first and then
                            later added support for more languages).  Additionally we can see that 2015 was the biggest year
                            for Kickstarter before decline.  That said make sure to look through the different metrics as
                            the decline is very different as we look things like project success and dollars pledged.

                            each country.  The further the country is from the inflection line the more or less likely similar
                            projects would be to succeed.

                            Perhaps this changes by country (presented as a filter)?

                            I hope that these visualizations have afforded you more insights into what the state is of Projects
                            launched on Kickstarter.  Hopefully you spent time reviewing a variety of selections of the data
                            specifically reviewing some of the details about successful and unsuccessful projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That said I think it is fair to say that anyone looking to launch a Kickstarter project is definitely
                            facing an uphill battle, perhaps that is why the number of projects launched in the past few
                            years has declined and the goal of those projects also seems to be decreasing.  That said, even
                            though the number of projects launched is on a decline, we can see that backer spending is declining
                            much more slowly, which would let us imply that backers are investing more on projects that they
                            are investing in (since there are less of them).  That said <b>the success rate of projects seems
                            to have remained steady around 40%</b>.  We can also see that some categories are clearly performing
                            better in certain geographies, though these are not the categories that one may think of, nor
                            do these appear to be consistent predictors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hopefully these trends mean that the projects that do launch on Kickstarter will continue to increase
                            in quality to earn their backers money.
                        </p>

                    This visualization utilizes an interactive slideshow layout to help identify characteristics
                    of successful Kickstarter Projects.  All visualizations and navigation are implemented
                    in pure JavaScript and use only the D3 Library.  Data was pre-processed to consolidate
                    the data files and to aggregate the data to a Year, Main Category, Country, Project State
                    grain (done using Tableau Prep) and stored as a simple CSV file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visualizations are presented in two groups.  First data is presented broken down by Country
                    to see if the geography of where a project is launched affects the project performance.
                    Then I present the data broken down by Main Category.  While analyzing the data by category
                    country is still presented as a filter to allow for insights gained in the first slides
                    to help navigate the data to finer points in the subsequent slides.  All visualize allow for
                    additional filters including in the stacked bar charts the categorical data of the stacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, each chart supports selecting the metric demonstrated on the visualization
                    via a series of toggles at the bottom of the chart.   Also of note, stacked bar charts are
                    limited to 20 categorical elements grouping all remaining elements into an "Other" bucket,
                    and scatter plots switch between linear and logrithmic scale depending on the range of the
                    data due to extreme skew (such as the US as a country) in the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 3 main annotations provided in the visualizations.  First in the stacked bar
                    charts I highlight years of importance to the data.  Then in the scatter plots I afford
                    the user a divider demonstrating the inflection point between successful and failed projects
                    for the selected metric.  Lastly all charts include tooltips to display numeric values
                    that may be hard to gather exactly from the visual and animations to introduce intrigue and
                    suspense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The presentation is configured to first investigate geography by showing general performance
                    over time (stacked bar chart) and then comparing successful to unsuccessful projects (scatter
                    plot).  Then I ask the user to consider if categories matter, but to maintain the flow I actually
                    reverse the order of the presentation to be the comparison first and then general performance over
                    time after.
